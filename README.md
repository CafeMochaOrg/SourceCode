CafeMocha
=========

It is incredibly difficult for students to publish creative writing, especially if they are in high school or college. Indeed, musicians can share their work with the world on SoundCloud and photographers can publish their work on flickr. But where do creative writers and poets go? 

That's why CafeMocha exists. http://CafeMocha.org is an fully engaged writing social network that allows young students to publish, share, and gain recognition for their writing around the world.  Other students can then read the work, make comments, and inspire conversations relating to the published ideas. The user receives credit and accolades for his/her published work while others are inspired to do something different. Additionally, professionals can discuss the works with the author and recruit him/her for a partnership.
