Schools seem to be producing robots. Students are conditioned never to be wrong. They are afraid to be incorrect. Failure is an infection in their eyes and as a result, many courses drain the innate creativity within students. In reality though, people will do their best work when they want to, not when working for grades or money. 

CafeMocha attempts to inspire creativity in the minds of high school students and adults alike. Anyone can publish his/her essays, papers, entrepreneurship ideas, and stories online. People then read the work, make comments, and inspire conversations relating to the published ideas. The user receives credit and accolades for his/her published work while others are inspired to do something different. Additionally, professionals can discuss the works with the author and recruit him/her for a partnership.
